## Unspeakable, the nagual


Your reason cannot fight the
physical knowledge that you are a` nameless cluster of feelings`. Your reason at this point might
even admit that there is another center of assemblage, the will, through which it is possible to
judge or assess and use the extraordinary effects of the nagual. It has finally dawned on your
reason that one can reflect the nagual through the will, although one can never explain it.


"Sorcerers do the same thing with their will," he said. "They say that through the will they can
witness the effects of the nagual. I can add now that through reason, no matter what we do with
it, or how we do it, we are merely witnessing the effects of the tonal. In both cases there is no
hope, ever, to understand or to explain what it is that we are witnessing.
