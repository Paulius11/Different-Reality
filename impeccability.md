## impeccability

'Impeccability is to do your best in whatever you're engaged in.'"
"But don Juan, my point is that I'm always under the impression I'm doing my best, and
obviously I'm not."
"It's not as complicated as you make it appear. The key to all these matters of impeccability is
the sense of having or not having time. As a rule of thumb, when you feel and act like an
immortal being that has all the time in the world you are not impeccable; at those times you
should turn, look around, and then you will realize that your feeling of having time is an idiocy.

"A warrior cannot be helpless," he said. "Or bewildered or frightened, not under any
circumstances. For a warrior there is time only for his impeccability; everything else drains his
power, impeccability replenishes it.

"You don't have any
time, and yet you're surrounded by eternity. What a paradox for your reason!






"The self-confidence of the warrior is not
the self-confidence of the average man. The average man seeks certainty in the eyes of the
onlooker and calls that self-confidence. The warrior seeks impeccability in his own eyes and
calls that humbleness. The average man is hooked to his fellow men, while the warrior is hooked
only to himself. Perhaps you are chasing rainbows. You're after the self-confidence of the
average man, when you should be after the humbleness of a warrior. The difference between the
two is remarkable. Self-confidence entails knowing something for sure; humbleness entails being
impeccable in one's actions and feelings.

You must push yourself beyond your limits, all the time."

There are lots of things that you do now which would have seemed insane to you ten years
ago. Those things themselves did not change, but your idea of yourself changed; what was
impossible before is perfectly possible now and perhaps your total success in changing yourself
is only a matter of time. In this affair the only possible course that a warrior has is to act
consistently and without reservations. You know enough of the warrior's way to act accordingly,
but your old habits and routines stand in your way.

"A double is the sorcerer himself, developed through his dreaming" don Juan explained. "A
double is an act of power to a sorcerer but only a tale of power to you. In the case of Genaro, his
double is indistinguishable from the original. That's because his impeccability as a warrior is
supreme; thus, you've never noticed the difference yourself. But in the years that you've known
him, you've been with the original Genaro only twice; every other time you've been with his
double."



"In the life of a warrior there is only one thing, one issue alone which is really undecided: how
far one can go on the path of knowledge and power. That is an issue which is open and no one
can predict its outcome. I once told you that the freedom a warrior has is either to act impeccably
or to act like a nincompoop. Impeccability is indeed the only act which is free and thus the true
measure of a warrior's spirit."


The size of the boulder made its fall
a very impressive event. Don Juan seized the opportunity to create a dramatic lesson. He said that
the force that rules our destinies is outside of ourselves and has nothing to do with our acts or
129volition. Sometimes that force would make us stop walking on our way and bend over to tie our
shoelaces, as I had just done. And by making us stop, that force makes us gain a precious
moment. If we had kept on walking, that enormous boulder would have most certainly crushed us
to death. Some other day, however, in another ravine the same outside deciding force would make
us stop again to bend over and tie our shoelaces while another boulder would get loose precisely
above where we are standing. By making us stop, that force would have made us lose a precious
moment. That time if we had kept on walking, we would have saved ourselves. Don Juan said
that in view of my total lack of control over the forces which decide my destiny, my only possible
freedom in that ravine consisted in my tying my shoelaces impeccably

"Impeccability is nothing else but the proper use of energy," he said. "My statements have no
inkling of morality. I've saved energy and that makes me impeccable. To understand this, you
have to save enough energy yourself.

Impeccability, as I have told you so many times, is not morality," he said. "It only resembles
morality. Impeccability is simply the best use of our energy level. Naturally, it calls for frugality,
thoughtfulness, simplicity, innocence; and above all, it calls for lack of self-reflection. All this
makes it sound like a manual for monastic life, but it isn't.
"Sorcerers say that in order to command the spirit, and by that they mean to command the
movement of the assemblage point, one needs energy. The only thing that stores energy for us is
our impeccability.



Warriors must be impeccable in their effort to change, in order to scare the human form and shake
it away. After years of impeccability, a moment will come when the human form cannot stand it
any longer and leaves. That is to say, a moment will come when the energy fields contorted by a
lifetime of habit are straightened out. A warrior gets deeply affected, and can even die as a result of
this straightening out of energy fields, but an impeccable warrior always survives.

The only freedom warriors have is to behave impeccably. Not only is impeccability freedom; it is
the only way to straighten out the human form.



Impeccability begins with a single act that has to be deliberate, precise, and sustained. If that act is
repeated long enough, one acquires a sense of unbending intent, which can be applied to
anything else. If that is accomplished the road is clear. One thing will lead to another until the
warrior realizes his full potential.




Don Juan said then that in the strategic inventories of warriors, self-importance figures as the
activity that consumes the greatest amount of energy, hence, their effort to eradicate it.
"One of the first concerns of warriors is to free that energy in order to face the unknown with
it," don Juan went on. "The action of rechanneling that energy is impeccability."
He said that the most effective strategy was worked out by the seers of the Conquest, the
unquestionable masters of stalking. It consists of six elements that interplay with one another.
Five of them are called the attributes of warriorship: control, discipline, forbearance, timing, and
will. They pertain to the world of the warrior who is fighting to lose self-importance. The sixth
element, which is perhaps the most important of all, pertains to the outside world and is called the
petty tyrant.
