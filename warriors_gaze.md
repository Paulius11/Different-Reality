## --- The warrior's gaze 


 "The warrior's gaze is placed on the right eye of the other person," he said. "And what it does
is to stop the internal dialogue, then the nagual takes over; thus, the danger of that maneuver.
Whenever the nagual prevails, even if it is only for an instant, there is no way of describing the
feeling that the body experiences. I know that you have spent endless hours trying to figure out
what you felt and that to this day you haven't been able to. I accomplished what I wanted, though.
I hooked you."


This is, naturally, only a way of talking," he continued. "A way of explaining weird physical
sensations."

"It works only when the warrior learns to focus his will" don Juan explained after he moved
his eyes away. "There's no way of practicing it, therefore I have not recommended or encouraged
its use. At a given moment in the life of a warrior it simply happens. No one knows how."


"The secret is in the left eye," he said. "As a warrior progresses on the path of knowledge his
left eye can clasp anything. Usually the left eye of a warrior has a strange appearance; sometimes
it becomes permanently crossed, or it becomes smaller than the other, or larger, or different in
some way.

# How to 

"The gaze on the right eye is not a stare," he said. "It's rather a forceful grabbing that one does hrough the eye of the other person. In other words, one grabs something that is behind the eye.
One has the actual physical sensation that one is holding something with the will."


* Carlos Castaneda 1968 - Tales of Power


# The power of silence

"The nagual's eyes can do that. It's not difficult. After all, the eyes of all living beings
can move someone else's assemblage point, especially if their eyes are focused on intent. Under
normal conditions, however, people's eyes are focused on the world, looking for food . . . looking
for shelter. . . ."

A good hunter mesmerizes his prey with his eyes," he went on. "With his gaze he moves the
assemblage point of his prey, and yet his eyes are on the world, looking for food.

"But, for sorcerers to use the shine of their eyes to move their own or anyone else's
assemblage point," he continued, "they have to be ruthless. That is, they have to be familiar with
that specific position of the assemblage point called the place of no pity. This is especially true
for the naguals."
