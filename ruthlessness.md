... He laughed and retorted that if this were the case,
why should be that I always demanded, without voicing it, that the people I dealt with be aware I
was deceiving them? The proof was that when they failed to be aware of my ploy and took my
pseudo-laxness at face value, I turned on them with exactly the cold ruthlessness I was trying to

mask is so effective. What you perceive as reasonableness is my lack of pity, because that's what
ruthlessness is: a total lack of pity.
"In your case, since you mask your lack of pity with generosity, you appear at ease, open. But
actually you are as generous as I am reasonable. We are both fakes. We have perfected the art of
disguising the fact that we feel no pity."
