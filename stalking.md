## The Wheel of Time

1. The first principle of the an of stalking is that warriors choose their battleground. A warrior never
goes into battle without knowing what the surroundings are.


2. To discard everything that is unnecessary is the second principle of the art of stalking. A warrior
doesn't complicate things. He aims at being simple. 

3. He applies all the concentration he has to
decide whether or not to enter into battle, for any battle is a battle for his life. This is the thirdprinciple of the art of stalking. A warrior must be willing and ready to make his last stand here and now. But not in a helter-skelter way.

4. A warrior relaxes and abandons himself; he fears nothing. Only then will the powers that guide
human beings open the road for a warrior and aid him. Only-then. That is the fourth principle of the
art of stalking

5. When faced with odds that cannot be dealt with, warriors retreat for a moment. They let their minds
meander. They occupy their time with something else. Anything would do. That is the fifth
principle of the art of stalking.

6. Warriors compress time; Even an instant counts. In a
battle for your life, a second is an eternity, an eternity that may decide the outcome. Warriors aim at
succeeding, therefore they compress time. Warriors don't waste an instant.

7. In order to apply the seventh principle of the art of stalking, one has to apply the other six: a stalker
never pushes himself to the front. He is always looking on from behind the scenes.


Applying these principles brings about three results.
1. learn never to take themselves seriously; they learn to laugh at themselves. If they are not afraid of being a fool,
they can fool anyone. 

2. Learn to have endless patience. Stalkers are
never in a hurry, they never fret.

3. stalkers learn to have an endless capacity to
improvise
