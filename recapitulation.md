## The Active Side of Infinity

It's called the recapitulation," he said. "The old sorcerers used to call it `recounting the events`
of your life, and for them, it started as a simple technique, a device to aid them in remembering
what they were doing and saying to their disciples. For their disciples, the technique had the same
value: It allowed them to remember what their teachers had said and done to them. It took terrible
social upheavals, like being conquered and vanquished several times, before the old sorcerers
realized that their technique had far-reaching effects."



"The premise of sorcerers is that in order to bring something in, there must be a space to put it
in," he said. "If you are filled to the brim with the items of everyday life, there's no **space for
anything new**. That space must be built. Do you see what I mean? The sorcerers of olden times
believed that the **recapitulation of your life made that space**. It does, and much more, of course.

### How to 

"The way sorcerers perform the recapitulation is very formal," he went on. "It consists of
 - writing a list of all the people they have met, from the present to the very beginning of their lives.
 - Once they have that list, they take the first person on it and recollect everything they can about
that person. `And I mean everything, every detail.`

 It's better to recapitulate from the present to the
past, because the memories of the present are fresh, and in this manner, the recollection ability is
honed. What practitioners do is to recollect and breathe. They inhale slowly and deliberately,
fanning the head from right to left, in a barely noticeable swing, and exhale in the same fashion."
He said that the inhalations and exhalations should be natural; if they were too rapid, one
would enter into something that he called tiring breaths: breaths that required slower breathing
afterward in order to calm down the muscles.

## Eagles gift


### About

 She explained that a recapitulation is the forte of **stalkers** as the dreaming body is the forte of
dreamers. It consisted of recollecting one's life down to the most insignificant detail. Thus her
benefactor had given her that crate as a tool and a symbol. It was a tool that would permit her to
learn concentration, for she would have to sit in there for years, until all of her life had passed in
front of her eyes. `And it was a symbol of the narrow boundaries of our person`. Her benefactor
told her that whenever she had finished her recapitulation, she would break the crate to symbolize
that she no longer abided by the limitations of her person.

She said that stalkers use crates or earth coffins in order to seal themselves in while they are
reliving, `more than merely recollecting, every moment of their lives.` The reason why stalkers
must recapitulate their lives in such a thorough manner is that the Eagle's gift to man includes its
willingness to accept a surrogate instead of genuine awareness, if such a surrogate be a perfect
replica. Florinda explained that since awareness is the Eagle's food, the Eagle can be satisfied
with a perfect recapitulation in place of consciousness.

### How to 

- first stage is a
brief recounting of all the incidents in our lives that in an obvious manner stand out for examination.

- The second stage is a more detailed recollection, which starts systematically at a point that
could be the moment prior to the stalker sitting in the crate, and theoretically could extend to the moment of birth.


### Explanation

Florinda explained that the key element in recapitulating was breathing. Breath for her was
magical, because it was a `life-giving function`. She said that recollecting was easy if one could
reduce the area of stimulation around the body. This was the reason for the crate; then breathing
would foster deeper and deeper memories. Theoretically, stalkers have to remember every
feeling that they have had in their lives, and this process begins with a breath. She warned me
that the things she was teaching me were only preliminaries, that at a later time, in a different
setting she would teach me the intricacies


### Breathing

Florinda said that her benefactor directed her to write down a list of the events to be relived.
He told her that the procedure starts with an initial breath. Stalkers begin with their chin on the
right shoulder and slowly inhale as they move their head over a hundred and eighty degree arc.
The breath terminates on the left shoulder. Once the inhalation ends, the head goes back to a
relaxed position. They exhale looking straight ahead. The stalker then takes the event at the top
of the list and remains with it until all the feelings expended in it have been recounted. As
stalkers remember the feelings they invested in whatever it is that they are remembering, they
inhale slowly, moving their heads from the right shoulder to the left. The function of this
breathing is to restore energy. Florinda claimed that the luminous body is constantly creating
cob-weblike filaments, which are projected out of the luminous mass, propelled by emotions of
any sort. Therefore, every situation of interaction, or every situation where feelings are involved,
is potentially draining to the luminous body. By breathing from `right to left` while remembering a
feeling, stalkers, through the magic of breathing, `pick up the filaments they left behind`. The next
immediate breath is from `left to right` and it is an exhalation. With it stalkers `eject filaments` left
in them by other luminous bodies involved in the event being recollected


### Mandatory preliminarie

She stated that these were the mandatory preliminaries of stalking, which all the members of
her party went through as an introduction to the more demanding exercises of the art. Unless
stalkers have gone through the preliminaries in order to retrieve the filaments they have left in the
world, and particularly in order to reject those that others have left in them, there is no possibility
of handling controlled folly, because those foreign filaments are the basis of one's limitless
capacity for self-importance. In order to practice controlled folly, since it is not a way to fool or
chastise people or feel superior to them, one has to be capable of laughing at oneself. Florinda
said that one of the results of a detailed recapitulation is genuine laughter upon coming face to
face with the boring repetition of one's self-esteem, which is at the core of all human interaction

## The power of Silence


"Recollecting is not the same as remembering," he continued. "Remembering is dictated by the
day-to-day type of thinking, while recollecting is dictated by the movement of the assemblage
point. A recapitulation of their lives, which sorcerers do, is the key to moving their assemblage
points. 
- Sorcerers start their recapitulation by thinking, by remembering the most important acts of
their lives. 
- From merely thinking about them they then move on to actually being at the site of the
event. 

When they can do that - be at the site of the event - they have `successfully shifted their
assemblage point` to the precise spot it was when the event took place. Bringing back the total
event by means of shifting the assemblage point is known as sorcerers' recollection."




## Wheel of time


One of the most important units, he called the
recapitulation, which consisted of a systematic scrutiny of one's life, segment by segment, an
examination made not in the light of criticism or finding flaw, but in the light of an effort to
understand one's life, and to change its course. Don Juan's claim was that once any practitioner has
viewed his life in the detached manner that the recapitulation requires, there's no way to go back to
the same life


> Carlos Castaneda  2000 -Wheele of time / Florinda p-147


## Magical Passes

To recapitulate is to relive every, or nearly every, experience that we have had, and in
doing so to displace the assemblage point, ever so slightly or a great deal, propelling it
by the force of memory to adopt the position that it had when the event being
recapitulated took place. This act of going back and forth from previous positions to the
current one gives the shaman practitioners the necessary fluidity to withstand
extraordinary odds in their journeys into infinity. To the Tensegrity practitioners, the
recapitulation gives the necessary fluidity to withstand odds which are not in any way
part of their habitual cognition.


A detailed recollection of minutiae is required as the proper means to hone one's
capacity to remember. This recollection entails getting all the pertinent physical details,
such as the surroundings where the event being recollected took place. Once the event
is arranged, one should enter into the locale itself, as if actually going into it, paying
special attention to any relevant physical configurations. If, for instance, the interaction
took place in an office, what should be remembered is the floor, the doors, the walls,
the pictures, the windows, the desks, the objects on the desks, everything that could
have been observed in a glance and then forgotten.The recapitulation as a formal procedure must begin by the recounting of events that
have just taken place. In this fashion, the primacy of the experience takes precedence.
Something that has just happened is something that one can remember with great
accuracy. Sorcerers always count on the fact that human beings are capable of storing
detailed information that they are not aware of, and that that detail is what the dark sea
of awareness is after.

The actual recapitulation of the event requires that one breathe deeply, fanning the
head, so to speak, very slowly and gently from side to side, beginning on one side, left or
right, whichever. This fanning of the head was done as many times as needed, while
remembering all the details accessible. Don Juan said that sorcerers talked about this
act as breathing in all of one's own feelings spent in the event being recollected, and
expelling all the unwanted moods and extraneous feelings that were left with us.


The list of names is used in the recapitulation as a mnemonic device that propels
memory into an inconceivable journey. Sorcerers' position in this respect is that
remembering events that have just taken place prepares the ground for remembering
events more distant in time with the same clarity and immediacy. To recollect
experiences in this way is to relive them, and to draw from this recollection an
extraordinary impetus that is capable of stirring energy dispersed from our centers of
vitality, and returning it to them. Sorcerers refer to this redeployment of energy that the
recapitulation causes as gaining fluidity after giving the dark sea of awareness what it is
looking for.


## Art of dreaming

The reason average people lack volition in their dreams is that they have never
recapitulated and their lives are filled to capacity with heavily loaded emotions like memories,
hopes, fears, et cetera, et cetera.
"Sorcerers, in contrast, are relatively free from heavy, binding emotions, because of their
recapitulation. And if something stops them, as it has **stopped you at this moment**, the assumption
is that there still is something in them that is not quite clear."
"To recapitulate is too involving, don Juan. Maybe there is something else I can do instead."
"No. There isn't. Recapitulating and dreaming go hand in hand. As we regurgitate our lives,
we get more and more airborne."
Don Juan had given me very detailed and explicit instructions about the recapitulation. It
consisted of reliving the totality of one's life experiences by remembering every possible minute
detail of them. He saw the recapitulation as the essential factor in a dreamer's redefinition and
redeployment of energy.
`"The recapitulation sets free energy imprisoned within us, and without this liberated energy
dreaming is not possible."` That was his statement.

Years before, don Juan had coached me to make a list of all the people I had met in my life,
starting at the present. He helped me to arrange my list in an orderly fashion, breaking it down
into areas of activity, such as jobs I had had, schools I had attended. Then he guided me to go,
without deviation, from the first person on my list to the last one, reliving every one of my
interactions with them.

He explained that recapitulating an event starts with one's mind arranging everything pertinent
to what is being recapitulated. Arranging means reconstructing the event, piece by piece, starting
by recollecting the physical details of the surroundings, then going to the person with whom one
shared the interaction, and then going to oneself, to the examination of one's feelings. 

 Don Juan taught me that the recapitulation is coupled with a natural, rhythmical breathing. Long
exhalations are performed as the head moves gently and slowly from right to left; and long
inhalations are taken as the head moves back from left to right. He called this act of moving the
head from side to side "fanning the event." The mind examines the event from beginning to end
while the body fans, on and on, everything the mind focuses on.
Don Juan said that the sorcerers of antiquity, the inventors of the recapitulation, viewed
breathing as a magical, life-giving act and used it, accordingly, as a magical vehicle; the
exhalation, to eject the foreign energy left in them during the interaction being recapitulated and
the inhalation to pull back the energy that they themselves left behind during the interaction.

Because of my academic training, I took the recapitulation to be the process of analyzing one's
life. But don Juan insisted that it was more involved than an intellectual psychoanalysis. He
postulated the recapitulation as a sorcerer's ploy to `induce a minute but steady displacement of the
assemblage point`. He said that the assemblage point, under the impact of reviewing past actions
and feelings, `goes back and forth between its present site and the site it occupied` when the event being recapitulated took place.

## Path To Recapitulation


1. Restoring the damages to our energetic body (recapitulation)
2. Changing the way we live to allow us to increase energetic actions
while diminishing antienergetic ones; "living purposefully


* The energetic intensity of the event
* The way we react in relation to the event
* Whether or not we settle an internal routine (doing) as a consequence of the event



### List 

So that you can have a simple idea of what kind of events are the ones
we need to recapitulate the most, the following list gives examples:

* Events during which you made promises that changed your life
* Events during which your vision about sex and affection
was created or modified
* Events during which you resigned or lost in any manner
something that was an authentic expression of your self
* Events during which your personal repetitive fears were
implanted
* Events with painful emotional interactions
* Events of great joy, which are your hidden memory about
happiness and how to achieve it
* Events involving your sexual experiences
* Events involving the meaningful relationships of your life
* Events about which you feel shame simply in remembering them
* Events related to the things you have been hiding from
others' eyes
* Events in which you can find parts of yourself that you normally
think are completely lost
* Events involving pain for the loss of somebody you loved
* Events involving joy from loving others
* Events during which the Great Spirit made a gesture to you
* Events during which you let your spirit express itself with no
restraints
* Events during which you betrayed your self or others

### Formulating Your List

a. Make a List of Areas or Sub-lists That Will Be Useful for You

1. Relatives
2. Friends
3. Partners
4. People I have had sex with
5. Companions in schools
6. Work mates
7. People related to my spiritual quest
8. People related to the world of music (if you are a musician—
you may adjust this category to your personal area of interest)

b. Write the Names of the People Related to Each List Area
c. Organize All the Names Into One Big List
d. Write Down the Events


Tips and Hints

* Work on your list in a place where and a moment when you are
not going to be disturbed.
* Work with deep concentration; take your time working on your
list—it is a ritual time to look into yourself.
* Work in sessions of at least one hour each.
* Try to work with it often enough that you do not lose all connec-
tion with the task of remembering in the time between two
sessions of work. Because of the risk of losing connection, inten-
sive periods of working on your list are more powerful than many
sessions spread over a long period of time.
* If you cannot engage yourself in a nonstop process, then try to
work with the list in segments without breaking your connection
with each segment until you have finished working with it.
Examples of segments might be; childhood or adolescence;
partners, and relatives.
