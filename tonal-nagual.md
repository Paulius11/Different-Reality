## Tonal 

"The tonal is the social person.
The tonal is, rightfully so, a protector, a guardian - a guardian that most of the time turns into a guard.

"The tonal is the organizer of the world," he proceeded. "Perhaps the best way of describing
its monumental work is to say that on its shoulders rests the task of setting the chaos of the world
in order. It is not farfetched to maintain, as sorcerers do, that everything we know and do as men
is the work of the tonal.
"At this moment, for instance, what is engaged in trying to make sense out of our conversation
is your tonal; without it there would be only weird sounds and grimaces and you wouldn't
understand a thing of what I'm saying.
"I would say then that the tonal is a guardian that protects something priceless, our very being.
Therefore, an inherent quality of the tonal is to be cagey and jealous of its doings. And since its
doings are by far the most important part of our lives, it is no wonder that it eventually changes,
in every one of us, from a guardian into a guard.


"A guardian is broad-minded and understanding," he explained. "A guard, on the other hand,
is a vigilante, narrow-minded and most of the time despotic. I say, then, that the tonal in all of us
has been made into a petty and despotic guard when it should be a broad-minded guardian."


The tonal is everything we are," he proceeded. "Name it! Anything we have a word for is the
tonal. And since the tonal is its own doings, then everything, obviously, has to fall under its
domain.


Don Juan reminded me that my argument had no basis for him, and that, long before, he had
already made the point that there was no world at large but only a description of the world which
we had learned to visualize and take for granted.
    "The tonal is everything we know," he said. "I think this in itself is enough reason for the
tonal to be such an overpowering affair.

The tonal begins at birth and ends at death."

"The island of the tonal has to be swept clean and maintained clean. That's the only alternative
that a warrior has. A clean island offers no resistance; it is as if there were nothing there.

### Methaphor 

"The tonal is an island," he explained. "The best way of describing it is to say that the tonal is
this."
He ran his hand over the table top.
"We can say that the tonal is like the top of this table. An island. And on this island we have
everything. This island is, in fact, the world.
"There is a personal tonal for every one of us, and there is a collective one for all of us at any
given time, which we can call the tonal of the times."
He pointed to the rows of tables in the restaurant.
"Look! Every table has the same configuration. Certain items are present on all of them. They
are, however, individually different from each other; some tables are more crowded than others;
they have different food on them, different plates, different atmosphere, yet we have to admit that
all the tables in this restaurant are very alike. The same thing happens with the tonal. We can say
that the tonal of the times is what makes us alike, in the same way it makes all the tables in this
restaurant alike. Each table separately, nevertheless, is an individual case, just like the personal
tonal of each of us. But the important factor to keep in mind is that everything we know about
ourselves and about our world is on the island of the tonal. 


"To explain all this is not that simple," he said. "No matter how clever the checkpoints of the
tonal are the fact of the matter is that the nagual surfaces. Its coming to the surface is always
inadvertent, though. The tonal's great art is to suppress any manifestation of the nagual in such a
manner that even if its presence should be the most obvious thing in the world, it is unnoticeable."

"But the sad fact is that all of us have learned to perfection how to make our tonal weak. I
have called that indulging."

He then clarified the issue by saying that in the past he had called that process seeing, and
that it consisted of a lull of true silence within, followed by an outward elongation of something
in the self, an elongation that met and merged with the other body, or with anything within one's
field of awareness.

He added that only a warrior had a "proper tonal," and that the average man, at
best, could have a "right tonal."


 The tonal is very vulnerable. It cannot withstand maltreatment. The white
man, from the day he set foot on this land, has systematically destroyed not only the Indian tonal
of the time, but also the personal tonal of every Indian. One can easily surmise that for the poor
average Indian the reign of the white man has been sheer hell. And yet the irony is that for
another kind of Indian it has been sheer bliss."


The nagual is not experience or
intuition or consciousness. Those terms and everything else you may care to say are only items on
the island of the tonal. The nagual, on the other hand, is only effect. The tonal begins at birth and
ends at death, but the nagual never ends. The nagual has no limit. I've said that the nagual is
where power hovers; that was only a way of alluding to it. By reasons of its effect, perhaps the
nagual can be best understood in terms of power. For instance, when you felt numb and couldn't
talk earlier today, I was actually soothing you; that is, my nagual was acting upon you.


One can say that the nagual accounts for creativity," he finally said and looked at me
piercingly. "The nagual is the only part of us that can create."


What is a proper tonal?" I asked.
"A tonal that is just right, balanced and harmonious. You are supposed to find one today, or
rather your power is supposed to bring one to us.

La Gorda recounted the way don Juan had instructed them about that crucial tonal-nagual
dichotomy. She said that one day the Nagual had all of them gather together in order to take them
for a long hike to a desolate, rocky valley in the mountains. He made a large, heavy bundle with
all kinds of items; he even put Pablito's radio in it. He then gave the bundle to Josefina to carry
and put a heavy table on Pablito's shoulders and they all started hiking. He made all of them take
turns carrying the bundle and the table as they hiked nearly forty miles to that high, desolate
place. When they arrived there, the Nagual made Pablito set the table in the very center of the
valley. Then he asked Josefina to arrange the contents of the bundle on the table. When the table
was filled, he explained to them the difference between the tonal and the nagual, in the same
terms he had explained it to me in a restaurant in Mexico City, except that in their case his
example was infinitely more graphic.
He told them that the tonal was the order that we are aware of in our daily world and also the
personal order that we carry through life on our shoulders, like they had carried that table and the
bundle. The personal tonal of each of us was like the table in that valley, a tiny island filled with
the things we are familiar with. The nagual, on the other hand, was the inexplicable source that
held that table in place and was like the vastness of that deserted valley.
He told them that sorcerers were obligated to watch their tonals from a distance in order to
have a better grasp of what was really around them. He made them walk to a ridge from where
they could view the whole area. From there the table was hardly visible. He then made them go
back to the table and had them all loom over it in order to show that an average man does not
have the grasp that a sorcerer has because an average man is right on top of his table, holding
133onto every item on it.
He then made each of them, one at a time, casually look at the objects on the table, and tested
their recall by taking something and hiding it, to see if they had been attentive. All of them passed
the test with flying colors. He pointed out to them that their ability to remember so easily the
items on that table was due to the fact that all of them had developed their attention of the tonal,
or their attention over the table.
He next asked them to look casually at everything that was on the ground underneath the table,
and tested their recall by removing the rocks, twigs or whatever else was there. None of them
could remember what they had seen under the table.


### Proper tonal

"There are, roughly speaking, two sides to every tonal. One is the outer part, the fringe, the
surface of the island. That's the part related to action and acting, the rugged side. The other part is
the decision and judgment, the inner tonal, softer, more delicate and more complex.
"The proper tonal is a tonal where the two levels are in perfect harmony and balance."

"For a proper tonal everything on the island of the tonal is a challenge. Another way of saying
it is that for a warrior everything in this world is a challenge. The greatest challenge of all, of
course, is his bid for power. But power comes from the nagual, and when a warrior finds himself
at the edge of the day it means that the hour of the nagual is approaching, the warrior's hour of
power."


## Nagual

The nagual, on
the other hand, is at the service of the warrior. It can be witnessed, but it cannot be talked about.

"There is no way of answering that. If I would say, Nothing, I would only make the nagual
part of the tonal. All I can say is that there, beyond the island, one finds the nagual.

In order to talk about it we must borrow from the island of the
tonal, therefore it is more convenient not to explain it but to simply recount its effects.


A warrior must be taught to be impeccable and
thoroughly empty before he could even conceive witnessing the nagual

The nagual can perform extraordinary things," he said. "Things that do not seem possible,
things that are unthinkable for the tonal. But the extraordinary thing is that the performer has no
way of knowing how those things happen. In other words, Genaro doesn't know how he does
those things; he only knows that he does them. The secret of a sorcerer is that he knows how to
get to the nagual, but once he gets there, your guess is as good as his as to what takes place."


Let's say that a warrior learns to tune his will, to direct it to a pinpoint, to focus it wherever he
wants. It is as if his will, which comes from the midsection of his body, is one single luminous
fiber, a fiber that he can direct at any conceivable place. That fiber is the road to the nagual. Or I
could also say that the warrior sinks into the nagual through that single fiber.
"Once he has sunk, the expression of the nagual is a matter of his personal temperament. If the
warrior is funny the nagual is funny. If the warrior is morbid the nagual is morbid. If the warrior
is mean the nagual is mean.


"It was something like that. When one meets the nagual face to face, one always has to be
alone. I was around only to protect your tonal. That is my charge."
Don Juan said that my tonal was nearly blasted to pieces when don Genaro descended from
the tree; not so much because of any inherent quality of danger in the nagual, but because my
tonal indulged in its bewilderment. He said that one of the aims of the warrior's training was to
cut the bewilderment of the tonal, until the warrior was so fluid that he could admit everything
without admitting anything

## Tonal and Nagual

"In the beginning, one has to talk to the tonal. It is the tonal that has to relinquish control. But
it should be made to do so gladly. For example, your tonal has relinquished some controls
without much struggle, because it became clear to it that, had it remained the way it was, the
totality of you would be dead by now. In other words, the tonal is made to give up unnecessary
things like self-importance and indulging, which only plunge it into boredom. The whole trouble
is that the tonal clings to those things when it should be glad to rid itself of that crap. The task
then is to convince the tonal to become free and fluid. That's what a sorcerer needs before
anything else, a strong, free tonal. The stronger it gets the less it clings to its doings, and the
easier it is to shrink it. So what happened this morning was that I saw the opportunity to shrink
your tonal. For an instant, you were absent-minded, hurrying, not thinking, and I grabbed that
moment to shove you


"He would witness nothing, just the trees being blown by a wild wind perhaps. We interpret
any unknown expression of the nagual as something we know; in this case the nagual might be
interpreted as a breeze shaking the leaves, or even as some strange light, perhaps a lightning bug
107of unusual size. If a man who doesn't see is pressed, he would say that he thought he saw
something but could not remember what. This is only natural. The man would be talking sense.
After all, his eyes would have judged nothing extraordinary; being the eyes of the tonal they have
to be limited to the tonal's world, and in that world there is nothing staggeringly new, nothing
which the eyes cannot apprehend and the tonal cannot explain."

### Eyes
"When one is dealing with the nagual, one should never look into it directly," he said. "You
were peering at it this morning, and therefore you were sapped. The only way to look at the
nagual is as if it were a common affair. One must blink in order to break the fixation. Our eyes
are the eyes of the tonal, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that our eyes have been
trained by the tonal, therefore the tonal claims them. One of the sources of your bafflement and
discomfort is that your tonal doesn't let go of your eyes. The day it does, your nagual will have
won a great battle. Your obsession or, better yet, everyone's obsession is to arrange the world
according to the tonal's rules; so every time we are confronted with the nagual, we go out of our
way to make our eyes stiff and intransigent. I must appeal to the part of your tonal which
understands this dilemma and you must make an effort to free your eyes. The point is to convince
the tonal that there are other worlds that can pass in front of the same windows. The nagual
showed you that this morning. So, let your eyes be free; let them be true windows. The eyes can
be the windows to peer into boredom or to peek into that infinity."


--
Whenever you are in the
world of the tonal, you should be an impeccable tonal; no time for irrational crap. But whenever
97you are in the world of the nagual, you should also be impeccable; no time for rational crap. For
the warrior, intent is the gate in between. It closes completely behind him when he goes either
way.

Don Juan had told us that human beings are divided in two. The right side, which he called the
tonal, encompasses everything the intellect can conceive of. The left side, called the nagual, is a
realm of indescribable features: a realm impossible to contain in words. The left side is perhaps
comprehended, if comprehension is what takes place, with the total body; thus its resistance to
conceptualization.


---

The new seers call the emphasized emanations the right side, normal awareness, the tonal, this
world, the known, the first attention. The average man calls it reality, rationality, common sense.
The emphasized emanations compose a large portion of man's band of awareness, but a very
small piece of the total spectrum of emanations present inside the cocoon of man. The
disregarded emanations within man's band are thought of as a sort of preamble to the unknown,
the unknown proper consisting of the bulk of emanations which are not part of the human band
and which are never emphasized. Seers call them the left-side awareness, the nagual, the other
world, the unknown, the second attention.
