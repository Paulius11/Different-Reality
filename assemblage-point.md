## Wheel of time
To see energy as it flows in the universe meant, to don Juan, the capacity to see a human being as a
luminous egg or luminous ball of energy, and to be able to distinguish, in that luminous ball of
energy, certain features shared by men in common, such as a point of brilliance in the already
brilliant luminous ball of energy. The claim of shamans was that it was on that point of brilliance,
which those shamans called the assemblage point, that perception was assembled. They could
extend this thought logically to mean that it was on that point of brilliance that our cognition of the
world was manufactured. 

Realizations are of two kinds. One is just pep talk, great outbursts of emotion and nothing more.
The other is the product of a shift of the assemblage point; it is not coupled with an emotional
outburst, but with action. The emotional realizations come years later after warriors have
solidified, by usage, the new position of their assemblage points.

The power of man is incalculable: death exists only because we have intended it since the moment
of our birth. The intent of death can be suspended by making the assemblage point change
positions.


The shaman seers of ancient times, through their seeing, first noticed that any unusual behavior
produced a tremor in the assemblage point. They soon discovered that if unusual behavior is
practiced systematically and directed wisely, it eventually forces the assemblage point to move.

In order for the mysteries of shamanism to be available to anyone, the spirit must descend onto
whoever is interested. The spirit lets its presence by itself move the man's assemblage point to a
specific position. This precise spot is known to shamans as the place of no pity.

There really is no procedure involved in making the assemblage point move to the place of no pity.
The spirit touches the person and his assemblage point moves. It is as simple as that.

Everything that warriors do is done as a consequence of a movement of their assemblage points,
and such movements are ruled by the amount of energy warriors have at their command.

Any movement of the assemblage point means a movement away from an excessive concern
with the individual self. Shamans believe it is the position of the assemblage point which makes
modern man a homicidal egotist, a being totally involved with his self-image. Having lost
hope of ever returning to the source of everything, the average man seeks solace in his selfishness.


## Magical Passes 

Those shamans discovered that on the back face of this luminous ball there is a point of
greater brilliance. They figured out, through processes of observing energy directly, that
this point is key in the act of turning energy into sensory data and then interpreting it.
For this reason, they called it the assemblage point, and deemed that perception is
indeed assembled there. They described the assemblage point as being located behind
the shoulder blades, an arm's length away from them. They also found out that the
assemblage point for the entire human race is located on the same spot, thus giving
every human being an entirely similar view of the world.


## The art of Dreaming

### Dreaming

"To fixate the assemblage point on any new spot means to acquire cohesion," he said. "You
have been doing just that in your dreaming practices."

"What is a dreaming position, don Juan?"
"Any new position to which the assemblage point has been displaced during sleep."
"How do we fixate the assemblage point on a dreaming position?"
"By sustaining the view of any item in your dreams, or by changing dreams at will. Through
your dreaming practices, you are really exercising your capacity to be cohesive; that is to say, you
are exercising your capacity to maintain a new energy shape by holding the assemblage point
fixed on the position of any particular dream you are having."
"Do I really maintain a new energy shape?"
"Not exactly, and not because you can't but only because you are shifting the assemblage point
instead of moving it. Shifts of the assemblage point give rise to minute changes, which are
practically unnoticeable. The challenge of shifts is that they are so small and so numerous that to
maintain cohesiveness in all of them is a triumph."
"How do we know we are maintaining cohesion?"
"We know it by the clarity of our perception. The clearer the view of our dreams, the greater
our cohesion."


## The fire frow Within 

Position of the assemblage point dictates how we `behave`
and how we `feel`.


### How it starts
He said that seers see that infants have no fixed assemblage point at first. Their encased
emanations are in a state of great turmoil, and their assemblage points shift everywhere in the
band of man, giving children a great capacity to focus on emanations that later will be thoroughly
disregarded. Then as they grow, the older humans around them, through their considerable power
over them, force the children's assemblage points to become more steady by means of an
increasingly complex internal dialogue. The internal dialogue is a process that constantly
strengthens the position of the assemblage point, because that position is an arbitrary one and
needs steady reinforcement.


# lateral shift

Those visions are the product of man's inventory," he went on. "They are of no value for
warriors in search of total freedom, because they are produced by a lateral shift of the assemblage
point."
He stopped talking and looked at me. I knew that by "lateral shift" he had meant a shift of the
point from one side to the other along the width of man's band of emanations instead of a shift in
**depth**. I asked him if I was right.

any person can reach that storehouse by simply stopping his internal dialogue. If the shift is minimal,
the results are explained as 

* fantasies of the mind.

 If the shift is considerable

* the results are called hallucinations.

"That force hooks itself immediately to the edges of the band," he went on. "On the right edge
we find endless visions of physical activity, violence, killing, sensuality. On the left edge we find
spirituality, religion, God. Genaro and I walked your assemblage point to both edges, so as to
give you a complete view of that human junk pile."


### Silence

He said that once inner silence is
attained, the bonds that tie the assemblage point to the particular spot where it is placed begin to
break and the assemblage point is free to move.
He said that the movement ordinarily is toward the left, that such a directional preference is a
natural reaction of most human beings, but that there are seers who can direct that movement to
positions below the customary spot where the point is located. The new seers call that shift "the
shift below.

Seers also suffer accidental shifts below," he went on. "The assemblage point doesn't remain
there long, and that's fortunate, because that is the place of the beast. To go below is counter to
our interest, although the easiest thing to do.


He also said that the old seers discovered that the assemblage point is not in the physical body,
but in the luminous shell, in the cocoon itself. The nagual identifies that spot by its intense
luminosity and pushes it, rather than striking it. The force of the push creates a dent in the cocoon
and it is felt like a blow to the right shoulder blade, a blow that knocks all the air out of the lungs.


Every living being has an assemblage point," he went on, "which selects emanations for
emphasis. Seers can see whether sentient beings share the same view of the world, by seeing if
the emanations their assemblage points have selected are the same."

He affirmed that one of the most important breakthroughs for the new seers was to find that
the spot where that point is located on the cocoon of all living creatures is not a permanent
feature, but is established on that specific spot by habit. Hence the tremendous stress the new
seers put on new actions, on new practicalities. They want desperately to arrive at new usages,
new habits.


"The new seers say that realization is the technique," he said. "They say that, first of all, one
must become aware that the world we perceive is the result of our assemblage points' being
located on a specific spot on the cocoon. Once that is understood, the assemblage point can move
almost at will, as a consequence of new habits."
I did not quite understand what he meant by habits. I asked him to clarify his point.

"The assemblage point of man appears around a definite area of the cocoon, because the Eagle
commands it," he said. "But the precise spot is determined by habit, by repetitious acts. First we
learn that it can be placed there and then we ourselves command it to be there. Our command
becomes the Eagle's command and that point is fixated at that spot. Consider this very carefully;
our command becomes the Eagle's command. The old seers paid dearly for that finding. We'll
come back to that later on.


"What happens to the persons whose assemblage points lose rigidity?" I asked.
"If they're not warriors, they think they're losing their minds," he said, smiling. "Just as you
thought you were going crazy at one time. If they're warriors, they know they've gone crazy, but
they patiently wait. You see, to be healthy and sane means that the assemblage point is
immovable. When it shifts, it literally means that one is deranged."
He said that two options are opened to warriors whose assemblage points have shifted. One is
to acknowledge being ill and to behave in deranged ways, reacting emotionally to the strange
worlds that their shifts force them to witness; the other is to remain impassive, untouched,
knowing that the assemblage point always returns to its original position.




## The power of silence 

The place of no pity is the site of ruthlessness," he said. "But you know all this. For the time
being, though, until you recollect, let's say that ruthlessness, being a specific position of the
assemblage point, is shown in the eyes of sorcerers. It's like a shimmering film over the eyes. The
eyes of sorcerers are brilliant. The greater the shine, the more ruthless the sorcerer is. At this
moment, your eyes are dull."
He explained that when the assemblage point moved to the place of no pity, the eyes began to
shine. The firmer the grip of the assemblage point on its new position, the more the eyes shone.
