    Dreamers - Dreaming body
        great facility for displacing the assemblage point

    Stalkers - Recapitulation
        great facility for maintaining the assemblage point fixed on that new position
        The art of stalking is learning all the quirks of your disguise

    -Right sigh awareness
    the tonal, where the first attention prevails
    -Left sight awareness
    and states of heightened awareness, the nagual, or the site of the second attention

    First attention hoked to emanations of earth
    Second attention is hoked to emanations of universe

    Fist attention - Belongs to physical body.
    Second attention - Belongs to luminous body.


    Warrior's greatest accomplishment in the second attention is  dreaming
    and in the first attention - stalking.
