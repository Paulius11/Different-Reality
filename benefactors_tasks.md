## Benefactors tasks


 - experience other states of non-ordinary reality
which he explained as being quite apart from those elicited to corroborate the rule of the allies;
- participate with him in certain special states of ordinary reality which he seemed to have produced himself

* Carlos Castaneda 1968 - The teachings of Don Juan p-100



Once the apprentice has been hooked, the instruction begins," he continued. "The first act of
a teacher is to introduce the idea that the world we think we see is only a view, a description of
the world. Every effort of a teacher is geared to prove this point to his apprentice. But accepting
it seems to be one of the hardest things one can do; we are complacently caught in our particular
view of the world, which compels us to feel and act as if we knew everything about the world. A
teacher, from the very first act he performs, aims at stopping that view. Sorcerers call it stopping
the internal dialogue, and they are convinced that it is the single most important technique that an
apprentice can learn.


Together with the right way of walking," don Juan went on, "a teacher must teach his
apprentice another possibility, which is even more subtle: the possibility of acting without
believing, without expecting rewards - acting just for the hell of it. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I
told you that the success of a teacher's enterprise depends on how well and how harmoniously he
guides his apprentice in this specific respect."
